            p.
              Clio is my pick for practice management/billing software for many
              firms as it provides a ton of integrations and customization,
              without an overwhelming learning curve.  The integrations create
              an efficient way to run your business without spending too much
              time or money. Use the Referral code #[span.underline RAYNA] to become assigned to
              us as your Clio Certified Pro Consultant.  We will work with you

            p.
              We have first-hand knowledge of how simple, mundane tasks of the
              everyday can eat away at your productivity.  Mailing, especially multiple
              mailings and certified mail take valuable time and resources.  CaseMail is an
              ingenious way to turn the mailing of documents into a simple process you can
              complete right from your computer. CaseMail does for physical mailing what
              e-fax options did for physical faxing. Try them out and tell them you heard it
              here!

              What is Chrometa?  It is a necessary tool for anyone looking to
              find that "lost" time.  Chrometa tracks time behind the scenes
              while you continue working.  It logs the actual time you spend in
              various applications (no more guessing). Download it to your
              smartphone and get your phone calls and text messages logged as
              well!  Simply assign those entries to a client/matter a few
              minutes each day and sync weekly with your billing programs!
              Integrate with existing billing and accounting options and save
              tons of data entry time.  Use our affiliate code “rayna” or

              clunky and time consuming.  ClicktoFile is the simplest way we

              Not accepting credit cards can actually lose valuable clients.

              Xero is one of the simplest, easiest accounting programs we have
              ever used.  It has some great integration to save time and money
              and best of all – it has payroll built in!  If you are tired of
              accounting programs that aren’t made for the average small
              business user, then Xero is worth your time!  #[a.colorSecondary-tint(href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7413348-12172457") Free trial]
