Their systematic procedures and efficiencies have increased our receiving time from on average of 98 days to 85% of all records being received within 30 days. Rayna’s services have allowed us to settle cases faster and focus on our clients instead of being tangled in the never-ending task of waiting on medical records.",

They also have been monumental in teaching us how to run our whole practice more smoothly. We get helpful hints and training on a daily basis and they are always available to answer questions. They know everything about Clio, Xero, Chrometa, and tons of other programs designed to help you keep time and work more efficiently.  Rayna has been a huge part of the growth of our firm, and we don't know where we'd be without them!",

Immediately she empathized with our small law firm billing and accounting issues—mainly time constraints! Fortunately, I found Lori’s services to be affordable for our small firm, and I hired her to help switch us to a more efficient accounting application. During the transition period, Lori always responded timely to my questions via email and/or by phone call, and regularly kept me apprised of the progress on her end.  Interestingly, I have never met Lori in person and she has never been to our office, because the entire implementation and training process was done seamlessly over the internet!  The fact that her services could be provided via the internet was a big plus in terms of allowing for flexibility based on my availability. I believe Lori’s background, personal experience, and knowledge, enables her to provide a niche service to firms like ours that need advice in choosing and fully implementing the right software and/or applications to help get timekeeping, billing, and accounting issues under control.   She has earned my recommendation.",
